Cheep ODM
----------


### What is it?

Cheep ODM is a simple reflection-based object document mapping for MongoDB in the spirit of cheep-orm (https://github.com/davidcarboni/cheep-orm). It does not attempt to solve any clever problems, but does give you Create, Read, Update, Delete and Find.

The mapping strategy is to go via JSON, using Google's GSON (https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide), so it's pretty straightforward to map your POJOs with minimum weight of annotation/configuration.
